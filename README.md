# My personal dotfiles

## Description

Expanded versions of standard bashrc, vimrc and other software I use everyday.
At this moment main upgrades are
- theme and settings for consistent look across different tools,
- custom command prompt with git,
- aliases,
- etc.

Theme - [Sweet theme](https://github.com/EliverLara/Sweet) with [Sweet
folders](https://github.com/EliverLara/Sweet-folders)

Cursors - [Oreo](https://github.com/varlesh/oreo-cursors)

Few lines in gtk.css for xfce panel to match the theme.

You can take a look at screenshots below to get the feeling of what's inside.
